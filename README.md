# Haunted Sewer

Just a little halloween game made in Unity. Took me about 15 hours I think. Made all the art myself :^)

## How do you run this game?
You can either clone this repo somewhere if you know how to use git
- click green code button
- copy https link
- open terminal -> git clone { url }
OR
- click green code button
- copy download as zip
- unzip your download

### Finally...
Run Haunted Sewer.exe
- Your computer won't want to start it! Click more options and run anyway.
- I promise there is no malicious code in the build.
